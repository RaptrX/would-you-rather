# “Would You Rather?” Project

This is the 2nd project in the React Nanodegree at udacity.

It is a simple web app which allows the user to play a game of would you rather?

Users are able to ask and answer questions, see which questions they have/haven’t answered, see question statistics and the ranking of users on the leaderboard.

Once the user logs in, they are able to toggle between their answered and unanswered questions on the home page.

Users can only vote once per poll; they are not allowed to change their answer after they’ve voted.

## To run it locally:

-   install all project dependencies with `npm install`
-   start the app with with `npm start`
-   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Note

This project uses a fake backend, so the state will not persist across refreshes.
